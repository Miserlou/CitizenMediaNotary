# Citizen Media Notary

Working on this. Don't use in production yet.

## Description

A system which enables 3rd party data observers who maintain a record of the authenticity of citizen media as it is recorded.

## Goals:

Secure-by-default.
Publically queriable (but perhaps not publicaly browsable.)
Easy to deploy.
Come up with a spec
Federated servers? PubSub, maybe?

## Language Choice

I think I'm going to do this one in Node because Django doesn't play super nicely with non relational databases.

The drawback is that Node is kind of a pain in the ass to deploy.

More details soon..
